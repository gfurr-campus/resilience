# The Resilent Campus Project
### The Global Forum of Urban and Regional Resilience
Our ultimate goal of this project is to investigate two interdependent questions: how can
universities internally measure and, if need be, strengthen the resilience of their infrastructure,
and how can universities contribute to the resilience of their local communities and regions? This
white paper will describe the analytical and quantitative methodology. Our analytical framework
will focus on three resilience categories: the built environment, the financial and economic
environment, and the university’s contribution to the local culture of resilience.<br /><br />
We collect data on various aspects of these categories described below in order to score each
university with regards to its expected resilience to various types of adverse outcomes. We report
the results of this investigation using an intuitive circular visualization, as well as categorical and
overall campus resilience scores. These results can be used to compare the predicted resilience of
one university to that of another, as well as to track a single university’s resilience over time. Our
framework is designed as a dynamic tool that universities and host communities can use to better
evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and to incorporate resilient strategies into their planning
process.
